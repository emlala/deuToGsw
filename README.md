# German to Swiss German xfst translator

This is a course project for a Language Technology course called Morphological Processing Tools 2. 

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with more traditional computational linguistics methods, using xfst script with an added lexicon file. This helped me to grasp the complexity of using rule-based systems for language technology purposes.

The translator programme translates Standard German numerals to Swiss German correspondents from the ZÃ¼rich region. There is an xfst-file that contains the program itself with the rules, and a lexc-file with the lexicon, which contains Standers German numerals 1-100, cardinal as well as ordinal.
